## How It Works

Each skill follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) **progressive disclosure** pattern. During discovery, an AI agent reads only the YAML frontmatter (~30-50 tokens) to decide relevance:

```yaml
---
name: performing-memory-forensics-with-volatility3
description: Analyze memory dumps to extract processes, network connections, and malware artifacts using Volatility3.
domain: cybersecurity
subdomain: digital-forensics
tags: [forensics, memory-analysis, volatility3, incident-response]
---
```

If the skill matches the task, the agent loads the full body -- workflow steps, prerequisites, tool commands, and verification checks -- without wasting tokens on irrelevant skills.

## Compatible Platforms

These skills work with any tool that supports the agentskills.io standard or can read structured Markdown:

| Platform | Integration |
|----------|------------|
| **Claude Code** | Native skill loading via `/plugin` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Workspace context via `.skills/` directory |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | File-based context injection |
| **Cursor** | Project rules and docs integration |
| **Gemini CLI** | Context file loading |
| **Amp** | Skill directory mounting |
| **Goose** | Plugin-based skill loading |
| **Windsurf** | Context awareness from project files |
| **Aider** | Repository map integration |
| **Continue** | Custom context providers |
| And 16+ others | Any agent that reads structured Markdown |
