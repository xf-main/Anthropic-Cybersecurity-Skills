## 🧠 How AI agents use these cybersecurity skills

Skills use a **progressive disclosure pattern** that minimizes token usage while maximizing agent capability. Here's what happens when you ask your AI agent to "analyze this memory dump for signs of compromise":

### Stage 1 · Discovery (~30–50 tokens per skill)

The agent scans **only YAML frontmatter** across all 753 skills. Each scan costs ~30–50 tokens — the entire collection can be indexed for under 40K tokens. The agent matches your task against `name`, `description`, `subdomain`, and `tags` fields to find relevant skills.

```yaml
# Agent reads ONLY this:
name: performing-memory-forensics-with-volatility3
description: Analyze memory dumps to extract processes, network connections, and malware artifacts using Volatility3.
subdomain: digital-forensics
tags: [forensics, memory-analysis, volatility3, incident-response]
```

### Stage 2 · Full workflow load (~200–500 tokens)

Once a skill matches, the agent loads the **complete `SKILL.md` body** — trigger conditions, prerequisites, step-by-step workflow, and verification checks. This gives the agent a structured playbook to follow.

### Stage 3 · Deep reference access (on demand)

For complex tasks, the agent pulls in **supporting files** from `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` — NIST standards mappings, detailed technical procedures, helper scripts, and report templates. These files are loaded only when the agent needs deeper context.

> **Result:** Irrelevant skills cost ~30 tokens. Relevant skills provide complete, structured, expert-level guidance. No wasted context window.

## 📝 Example cybersecurity skills

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Memory forensics with Volatility3</b> — DFIR domain</summary>

````yaml
---
name: performing-memory-forensics-with-volatility3
description: >-
  Analyze memory dumps to extract running processes, network connections,
  injected code, and malware artifacts using the Volatility3 framework.
domain: cybersecurity
subdomain: digital-forensics
tags: [forensics, memory-analysis, volatility3, incident-response, dfir]
version: "1.0"
author: mukul975
license: Apache-2.0
---

## When to Use

- Incident responder needs to analyze a memory dump from a compromised host
- Investigating potential malware infection or lateral movement
- Extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs) from volatile memory
- Identifying injected code, hidden processes, or rootkit activity
- Memory dump file (.raw, .mem, .dmp, .vmem) is available for analysis

## Prerequisites

- **Volatility3** installed (`pip install volatility3`)
- Memory dump file acquired from target system
- **Python 3.8+** runtime environment
- Symbol tables for target OS (auto-downloaded by Volatility3)
- Sufficient disk space for analysis output (~2x memory dump size)

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the operating system profile

Run the banner and `windows.info` (or `linux.info` / `mac.info`) plugin to
auto-detect the OS version and confirm the dump is valid:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.info
```

### Step 2 — List running processes

Extract the process tree to identify suspicious or unexpected processes:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.pslist
vol -f memory.raw windows.pstree
vol -f memory.raw windows.psscan    # Finds hidden/unlinked processes
```

Look for: unusual parent-child relationships, processes with suspicious names,
processes running from temp directories, unsigned executables.

### Step 3 — Analyze network connections

Extract active and closed network connections:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.netscan
vol -f memory.raw windows.netstat
```

Flag: connections to known-bad IPs, unusual ports (4444, 8443, 1337),
beaconing patterns, connections from non-browser processes.

### Step 4 — Detect code injection

Scan for injected code in process memory:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.malfind
```

Review output for: PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE memory regions, MZ headers in
non-image regions, shellcode signatures, hollow process indicators.

### Step 5 — Extract artifacts

Dump suspicious processes, DLLs, and drivers for further analysis:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.dumpfiles --pid <PID>
vol -f memory.raw windows.dlllist --pid <PID>
vol -f memory.raw windows.handles --pid <PID>
```

### Step 6 — Check persistence mechanisms

Examine registry hives and services loaded in memory:

```bash
vol -f memory.raw windows.registry.hivelist
vol -f memory.raw windows.svcscan
vol -f memory.raw windows.cmdline
```

## Verification

- [ ] OS profile correctly identified and dump validated
- [ ] Complete process tree exported and anomalies flagged
- [ ] Network connections reviewed and suspicious IPs documented
- [ ] Malfind output reviewed — injected code regions identified
- [ ] Suspicious binaries dumped for downstream malware analysis
- [ ] IOCs extracted (IPs, domains, file hashes, mutex names)
- [ ] Findings documented in incident report with timestamps

<summary><b>🦠 Reverse engineering .NET malware with dnSpy</b> — Malware Analysis domain</summary>

````yaml
---
name: analyzing-dotnet-malware-with-dnspy
description: >-
  Decompile, analyze, and extract IOCs from .NET-based malware samples
  using dnSpy for static analysis and behavioral understanding.
domain: cybersecurity
subdomain: malware-analysis
tags: [malware, reverse-engineering, dotnet, dnspy, static-analysis]
version: "1.0"
author: mukul975
license: Apache-2.0
---

## When to Use

- Triaging a suspected .NET malware sample (.exe or .dll compiled with CLR)
- Extracting hardcoded C2 URLs, encryption keys, or configuration data
- Understanding malware behavior before dynamic analysis
- Analyzing obfuscated .NET payloads (ConfuserEx, SmartAssembly, etc.)
- Building detection signatures (YARA, Sigma) from decompiled source

## Prerequisites

- **dnSpy** (or dnSpyEx fork) installed on analysis workstation
- Isolated malware analysis environment (VM with snapshots)
- **PE analysis tool** (CFF Explorer, PE-bear, or pestudio) for initial triage
- **de4dot** for automated .NET deobfuscation
- Sample SHA256 hash documented before analysis begins
- Network monitoring tools (Wireshark/FakeNet-NG) for dynamic validation

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Initial triage and environment setup

Confirm the sample is a .NET assembly before opening in dnSpy:

```bash
# Check for CLR metadata
file sample.exe
# Look for .NET version string, mscoree.dll import
pestudio sample.exe
```

Take a VM snapshot. Disable network adapters. Document sample hash.

### Step 2 — Deobfuscate if protected

Many .NET malware families use obfuscation. Run de4dot first:

```bash
de4dot sample.exe -o sample_clean.exe
```

Check output log for identified obfuscator (ConfuserEx, Dotfuscator,
SmartAssembly, Babel, Eazfuscator). If de4dot fails, note the packer
for manual unpacking in dnSpy.

### Step 3 — Load and explore in dnSpy

Open the cleaned binary in dnSpy. Start with high-level reconnaissance:

1. **Assembly Explorer** — Review namespaces, classes, entry point
2. **Entry point** (`Main()` or module initializer) — Trace execution flow
3. **Resources** — Check for embedded payloads, encrypted configs
4. **String references** — Search for URLs, IP addresses, registry keys
5. **References** — Note any P/Invoke calls (Win32 API) indicating native interaction

### Step 4 — Identify C2 infrastructure and configuration

Search decompiled source for network indicators:

- Hardcoded URLs, IP addresses, domain names
- Base64-encoded strings (decode in CyberChef)
- XOR / AES decryption routines with embedded keys
- HTTP User-Agent strings, custom headers
- Registry keys or file paths used for persistence

Set breakpoints in dnSpy debugger at decryption functions to capture
plaintext config at runtime if static extraction fails.

### Step 5 — Map capabilities to MITRE ATT&CK

Document each observed capability:

- **Execution method** — Process injection, scheduled tasks, WMI
- **Persistence** — Registry Run keys, startup folder, services
- **Credential access** — Browser credential theft, keylogging
- **Exfiltration** — HTTP POST, DNS tunneling, cloud storage APIs
- **Evasion** — Anti-VM checks, sleep timers, sandbox detection

### Step 6 — Extract IOCs and build detections

Compile all indicators into a structured IOC list:

```
# Network IOCs
C2: https://evil-domain[.]com/gate.php
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0)
DNS: ns1.malware-c2[.]net

# Host IOCs
Mutex: Global\{GUID-HERE}
Registry: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchost
File: %APPDATA%\svchost.exe (SHA256: abc123...)
```

Write YARA rule targeting unique strings or byte patterns.

## Verification

- [ ] Sample identified as .NET assembly and hash documented
- [ ] Deobfuscation attempted — obfuscator identified and handled
- [ ] Entry point traced — full execution flow mapped
- [ ] C2 infrastructure extracted (URLs, IPs, domains, ports)
- [ ] Encryption keys / decryption routines documented
- [ ] Capabilities mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- [ ] IOC list exported in structured format (STIX, OpenIOC, or CSV)
- [ ] YARA detection rule written and tested against sample
